## Contribution Process

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the main repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix (e.g., `git checkout -b improve-data-loader`). Choose a descriptive branch name.
3.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your improvements or fixes. Focus on writing clear, efficient, and well-commented code.
4.  **Ensure Code Quality:**
    *   Thorougly test your code & explain / screenshot tests in the pull request comments. Think of all edge cases and failure modes and make sure to test on them.
    *   Ensure existing tests pass (if applicable).
5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your work with clear and concise commit messages.
6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository (`git push origin improve-data-loader`).
7.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Open a Pull Request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch (you can do this from your repo by selecting the branch and clicking `contribute` -> `Open Pull Request`).
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    *   Explain the motivation behind your changes ("why") and what you did ("what").
    *   If your PR addresses an existing issue, link to it (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Keep PRs focused on a single logical change or feature. Larger changes should ideally be broken down into smaller PRs.

## Code Style

*   Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
*   Keep functions focused on a single task.

## Communication

*   **Issues:** Feel free to open an issue to discuss potential changes, ask questions, or report bugs before starting significant work. This helps ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals.
*   **Pull Requests:** Be responsive to feedback on your PR. Engage in discussions constructively.
